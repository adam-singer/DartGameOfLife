Example of using dart to create [Conway's game of life.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)
Code was inspired by [Edwin Martin](http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/) and worked on at the [SF code retreat] (http://sfcoderetreat.wordpress.com/). This particular implemenation may not be the best, was interested in exercising in [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/) and [Google Gadget](http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/docs/gs.html)

A deployed application as a google gadget can be found here [dartgameoflife](https://sites.google.com/site/dartgameoflife/).
